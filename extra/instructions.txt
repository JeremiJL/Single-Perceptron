Write Implementation of perceptron.

Program allows training a perceptron that recognizes 2 classes.
User provide arguments (command line arguments or in command line after run or in gui):
-path to file with training data
-path to file with test data
-learning rate
-number of epochs - one epoch is one training iteration through the whole training data

Weights and threshold of perceptron are initialized as some small numbers close to 0. Perceptron is trained using delta rule for a given number of epochs on the training data.
Print accuracy on the test set after each epoch.

Training data may be shuffled after each epoch to get better results.

After training and testing,  program asks in a loop:
enter new observations from command line (or gui) and predict the class
exit program

Program should be universal (same as for knn) - it should work for any number of numerical attributes and one decision attribute that may take exactly 2 nominal values.
The program should be written independently. It is not possible to use ready-made libraries implementing machine learning algorithms.

The code (only the file with code not the whole project) should be placed in the appropriate task on the teamsâ€™ platform before class
es and presented during classes.
Only programs that meet the described requirements will be checked!

Optional: graphical visualization of perceptron on 2 dimensional data
